# Tailwind CSS Guide

This document outlines the steps to install and configure Tailwind CSS for your project. Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

## Installation

Tailwind CSS relies on a few dependencies. To install these, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer cssnano
```

This will install Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer, and CSSNano. These tools are used to process your CSS files.

## Development Build

For development purposes, you can create a specific Tailwind CSS file that includes all styles. This is useful for live-reloading and previewing changes during development.

Run this command to create the development build:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./config/tailwind.css -o ./css/tailwind-dev.css --watch
```

The `-i` option specifies the input file, `-o` specifies the output file, and `--watch` makes the process keep running, automatically rebuilding when you make changes to your CSS.

## Production Build

For a production build, you'll want to minify your CSS to reduce file size. This process removes all the spaces, line breaks, and comments that make CSS readable to humans but are unnecessary for machines.

To create a minified version of your CSS, run:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -o ./css/tailwind-min.css --minify
```

The `--minify` option will output a minified version of your CSS suitable for production use.

## Custom Configuration

Tailwind CSS can be customized to fit your project's needs. You can adjust your settings in the `tailwind.config.js` file, and you can add your own styles to the `config/tailwind.css` file.

## Minification Configuration

If you need to configure the minification process or add more PostCSS plugins, you can modify the `postcss.config.js` file. This file defines how PostCSS should process your CSS.

Remember to test your changes thoroughly before pushing to production to ensure that your styles are applied correctly.
